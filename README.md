Changelog
----------

### 0.0.2

**NOTE**: This version breaks compatability with version 0.0.1.

Now there's no default implementation for Rtree. This means that you **must** create it with something like this:

```ocaml
module My_rtree = Rtree.Make(Some_module : Spatial_index.Rtree_intf.S)
open My_rtree
```

* R-Tree implementation with functor.
* Bounding box implementation with functor: now its possible to change type of bounding box units from `float` to any other numeric type.

### 0.0.1

* basic R-Tree implementation
